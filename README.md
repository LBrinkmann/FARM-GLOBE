🌍 What is FARM-GLOBE?

FARM-GLOBE uses the FARM (FastAPI, React, and MongoDB) technical stack to provide a template for building robust and scalable group experiments online. It is designed for scenarios where large, complex group experiments require real-time processing of participant responses.

📝 Description

The FARM-GLOBE framework is a powerful tool for creating online group behavioral experiments. While there are existing frameworks available, none of them met our specific requirements, which include real-time calculations and database calls through a backend server, a flexible and dynamic frontend framework, and scalability for large group experiments.

🔍 When to use FARM-GLOBE?

FARM-GLOBE is ideal for researchers and developers who need to create large and complex online group behavioral experiments that require real-time processing of participant responses.

❌ When not to use FARM-GLOBE?

FARM-GLOBE may not be the best choice for those looking to create simple online behavioral experiments, as it requires some basic knowledge of web development to implement.
